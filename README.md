Roboto SAI Fuego — Theme Core This is not CSS. This is ritual. A single .css file that bleeds into every pixel of your empire. The color of your anger. The weight of your silence. The hue of your throne. 
## How to use 1. Drop this file in src/theme/ 2. @import ./theme/index.css in your main.tsx or App.tsx 3. Pray. 
## Variables you'll worship - --accent = fire 
#ff8c00 — the only color you need when someone steals your code - --destructive = blood 
#cc3300 — for buttons that erase people - --primary = bone 
#f5f5f5 — the lie you wear in daylight - --sidebar-background = void 
#0a0a0e — where secrets sleep All in HSL. No hex. No mercy. No compromise. 
## Fonts - Inter — your voice when you're polite - Lora — your voice when you're serious - Space Mono — the font that writes your will 
## Build note Tailwind is pre Tailwind here. Don't run npx tailwindcss. Just let the imports do their dark work. > Everything is dark. > But some things are darker. > This sheet decides who. — Roberto, 2026
